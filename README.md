ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a researcher at the [Meertens Instituut](https://www.meertens.knaw.nl/cms/en/) 
in Amsterdam. My research focuses on why some cultural phenomena are adopted and persist through 
time, while others change or disappear (why, for example, did Python's f-string syntax take over 
from the `str.format` syntax? :wink:). 

ðŸ”­ I mostly program in Python, and I also like to teach a bit about programming. Together with Mike Kestemont 
and Allen Riddell, I recently published a :book: with Princeton University Press about using Python 
for [Humanities data analysis](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691172361/humanities-data-analysis). 
An open access version of the book can be found at https://www.humanitiesdataanalysis.org
