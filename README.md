ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a researcher at the [Meertens Instituut](https://www.meertens.knaw.nl/cms/en/) 
in Amsterdam. My research focuses on why some cultural phenomena are adopted and persist through 
time, while others change or disappear (why, for example, did Python's f-string syntax take over 
from the `str.format` syntax? :wink:). Additionally, I'm interested in measuring cultural
diversity and compositional complexity, and how we can account for biases in our estimations 
of diversity. 
(check out our recent publication on estimating the amount of lost books in 
[Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7655)).

ðŸ”­ I mostly program in Python, and I also like to teach a bit about programming. Together with Mike Kestemont 
and Allen Riddell, I recently published a :book: with Princeton University Press about using Python 
for [Humanities data analysis](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691172361/humanities-data-analysis). 
An open access version of the book can be found at https://www.humanitiesdataanalysis.org
