ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a researcher at the [Meertens Instituut](https://www.meertens.knaw.nl/cms/en/) 
in Amsterdam. My research focuses on why some cultural phenomena are adopted and persist through 
time, while others change or disappear (why, for example, did Python's f-string syntax take over 
from the `str.format` syntax? :wink:). 

ðŸ”­ I mostly program in Python, and I also like to teach a bit about programming. There's a :book: coming out 
in January 2021 about using Python for [Humanities data analysis](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691172361/humanities-data-analysis)!
